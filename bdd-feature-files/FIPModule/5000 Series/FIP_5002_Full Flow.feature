Feature:On calling Full Flow APIs except account discovery and consent notification, Send the account link
  request,and account link verify request. Set the Consent notification response in mock server, and in consent
  post request. Set the FI Notification response in Mock server. Send the FI request, wait for FI ready notification,
  send the FI fetch request, and finally delink the account request in sequence for double account user for each
  supported FIType. Check that all the APIs are responding with success response and Verify that the response code of
  all APIs is 200.
